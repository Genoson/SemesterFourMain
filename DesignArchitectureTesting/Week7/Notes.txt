Monday june 13th 

Sprint next week. Whats the goal?
^^ Building a large set of java classes ( work with collections and data transformation)
^^ using mocking to test these classes
^^ we will be cloning a master from Jamie, and work on a branch together as a team, 
^^^^ simulating a production environment.

Helping Barry with a test based error
^^ has 4 vscode instances open while in a teams call and sharing screen
^^ everything is running at a snails pace


Object mocking to be covered with remainder of class
^^ from the top no less

Object mocking is a way to control the behaviour of our software when we run it in a test.
^^ simulate external dependencies (like a database, or API call)

Lets us focus the test on the specific method we want to test.

None of the code in the mocking example is production grade or secure. just examples.
^^ the above referenced sample code is found below:

June 15 lecture
*** not til after the sprint ***  we are lagging behind the semester outcomes ***
^^ introducing the idea of spring boot framework and the MVC pattern
^^ the MVC pattern is a way to structure our code so that we can easily change our code
^^ MVC = Model View Controller 
*** MySQL will follow spring boot ***


Looking at mocking yet again
^^ When to use it?
^^^^ Mock communication with services outside the class under test
^^^^^^ databases, web calls, api interactions, etc.


Java has built in logging capabilities.
^^ we use log aggregators to aggregate logs from multiple sources.
^^ we won't usually test logging in a unit test sense

Sprint 
^^ a java program that takes command line prompts and returns values ( ie: golf tournament)
^^ develop rigorous testing and mocking for this program
