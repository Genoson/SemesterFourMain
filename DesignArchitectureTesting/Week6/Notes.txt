QAP review - I'm good

Do mocking and mockito practice.... I have annies QAP 2 to recode as a TDD project


* Be aware of Java naming conventions
* Use access modifiers
* Use package structures
* Typically never use new keyword with String object
^^ String methods are important, learn them
^^ Strings are immutable but you can return substrings etc via the methods
** Create a string method document **

* Practice the command prompt (terminal) commands
^^ zsh, bash
^^ git
^^^^ git status - 
^^^^ git pull - pulls from remote
^^^^ git push - pushes to remote
^^^^ git clone <repo>

Trunk based PR workflow
^^ Pull request - a branch that is created from the remote branch
** do some research on this **

git branch <branch name>
^^ creates a branch, function built in to IDE usually
git checkout <branch name>
^^ switches to branch

** pay more attention to .gitignore **

after pushing a branch
^^ pull request - create a pull request on github
^^ merge pull request - merge the pull request

** Knowing PR workflow is a very hirable skill **
^^ Jamie is a great mentor
^^^^ He is going to rejigger an assignment to be a pull request submission

Clone master, create a branch, push to remote, create pull request, Code Review, merge pull request
^^ This is a very common workflow
** do one of these **
^^ set it up for my KPM group


June 8 class

reviewing the simple github pr request task

Set up the SSH keys
^^ follow along with the documentation and generate it on my computer


from cli - 
select the working directory locally
git status - shows the status of the working directory
git commit -m "message" - commits the changes to the local repository
git push - pushes the local repository to the remote repository

as git is the basic workflow of any good software setting, we will be working in this
environment and we will be mentored into the job

Most project will require approval to merge into the master
tag the owner/ senior developer using @ in comments to alert them

Figure out how to include a database, and how to include a web server
In java

Revise the old react app/ build a new one.... probably build a new one


Jamie is comfortable with the progress we made this semester
^^ i feel like we have been moving at a snails pace, and have gotten next to nothing done
