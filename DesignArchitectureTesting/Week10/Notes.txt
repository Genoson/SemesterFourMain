Sprint feedback, general
^^ handling merge conflicts best practices
^^^^ don't let it get to gnarly, focus on small changes and frequent updates
^^^^ Scrap a highly divergent branch and create a new one, then make the changes again

^^ Be aware of the affect of inheritance and aggregation on code functionality and complexity

Feedback will be provided as a code review


Now we are starting architectural frameworks

Spring/SpringBoot - Basic demo and expectations set this week

Rest API - basic demo and expectations set this week

Jamie uses a fusion approach rather than the provided dependencies explicitly

Afterwords we will connect to a DB and upload and download objects

SpringBoot
^^ a java framework for building web applications
^^^^ very powerful, easy to use, and easy to learn

Apache Tomcat - a Java servlet container
^^ WAR file - a Java archive file format that can contain a web application
^^^^ JAR file - a Java archive file format that can contain a set of files and classes

Ready to connect to Docker
^^ Docker is a containerization technology that provides a way to run applications on a Linux-based 
^^^^operating system without the need to install and manage software.

MVC - Model View Controller pattern
^^ a design pattern that separates the view from the model
^^^^ the view is the user interface, the model is the data, and the controller is the glue between the two


Jamie project walkthrough
^^ A basic springboot project
^^^ on his github repo -> clone it and get it working
^^^^ would need to set up mysql and connect to that

pom file with Springboot dependencies
and data access dependencies

jpa - Java Persistence API
^^ a Java API for accessing and managing persistent data
^^^ very powerful and easy to use tool for accessing SQL databases
^^^ will pull properly aggregated data from the database
^^^^ code parsing to auto generate SQL queries

This framework does a lot of the heavy lifting for you


postman - a tool for testing APIs


Ask Jamie - should we be designing our Java data in a similar way to how we would for a SQL database?
