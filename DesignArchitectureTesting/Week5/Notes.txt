Monday May 30 Lecture

Q and A with regards to the QAP today...

^^  different assertion methods in Junit

^^  What is null???
^^ ^^ an empty memory address, the absence of a value



Mock objects coming on wednesday
^^ pretend database with prepopulated data for testing

Jamie on static
^^ static behaviour requires extra care as it can be accessed from anywhere
^^ 



think about reuse when grouping classes together
^^ store them in different packages if they aren't strictly related
^^ easier to keep tests with the codebase it tests

Slow and steady coding is a perfectly alright way to work

Wednesday class... mock objects?

Mockito is the mocking library of choice for Jamie
^^ its fun, working in the folder here, will rework a project with mock testing
^^ probably ainees qap2
