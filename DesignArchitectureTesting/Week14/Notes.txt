For the Final Sprint
^^ The trickiest part of this sprint will be the permissions on AWS
^^ and designing and implementing the AWS architecture we need
^^ Refactor, refactor, refactor


We've agreed to use my front end as the front end for the project for the entire class
^^ we need to create a repo in a organization and work together to maintain dev ops


Team component - Main project
^^ hosting an API on AWS, JAVA back end (spring/boot), MySQL RDS database, and a react front end
^^ Unit tests for the network calls are optional
^^ unit tests for the JAVA methods are required, in a basic sense
^^ Front end should be modified to use the new API 

AWS steps:
Steps to deploy dockers images to AWS: part 1.
