Communion with the Old Gods
^^ Taken as part of a ritual, often requiring a special location, item and a sacrifice
^^ the player will be given the opportunity to commune with the old gods @ lvl 5, 10 and 15.
^^ alternatives to communion also exist

Communion of Flesh 
^^ str +1, hp +2/lvl, str unlocked

Communion of Heart
^^con +2, con unlocked, dmg all sources -1

Communion of Spirit

Communion of Voice
^^ cha +2, cha unlocked, immunity to charm and silence 0

The above are the base communions
players may choose to take the same communion multiple times
^^ in doing so the stat unlock will be replaced with a bonus of significant value

All the above communions are taken as a ritual via an NPC 
^^ the communion is taken from the corpse of the long dead nameless god

It is possible to encounter a living god(or their followers) and instead take communion with it.
^^ most easily done in the southern kingdom cult of Oztalun
^^ these communions will offer similar yet different benefits
^^ the player may negotiate with the god to customize these 

Taking communion with the same god as your sign unlocks a synergy bonus
^^ these will be relative to the god and the type of communion
^^ examples:
^^ Sign of Ulthar + Communion of Spirit(Ulthar)
^^^^ grants all standard benefits + a spirit guide familiar accompanies the player
^^ Sign of Ulthar + Communion of Flesh(Ulthar)
^^^^ grants all standard benefits + a passive Regrowth effect 3HP/turn while in nature environments

An example of a negotiated communion:
^^ Communion of Flesh(Vorvadoss) 
^^^^ "Lord I require not my voice while your flesh and mine are one"
^^^^ standard benefits + -2 cha and +2 str
