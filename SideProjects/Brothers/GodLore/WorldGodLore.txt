The Old gods 

In this setting the typical pantheons of the sword coast do not exist.

The old gods are entire planes of existence, bound into a single entity.

The elemental planes, lower and upper circles ( demons and celestials) etc all 
either do not exist or exist only as puppets to the old gods.

The 12th old god was slain just ahead of the crusade that nearly wiped practicing 
magick users off the face of the world.

This god, whos name is no longer known, wiped from our collective consciousness at it's moment 
of death by the ritual that struck it down.

It's 'corpse' fell to earth far to the north and east in a barren dessert of death, blight 
and inhospitable weather. 

The flesh of this being contains all the power the god once held. All are forbidden to approach it.
^^ an Orc tribe was known to have had a Great warrior make the journey and return.
^^ This warrior Gruumsh has been diefied by Orcs.
^^ Gruumsh led the orcs in a conquest of much of the world after the crusade. Prompting 
^^ the other races to put aside their differences and push the orcs back. 
^^^^ Gruumsh is rumoured to still live in a deep dark hold at the center of Orcish territory
^^^^^^ This rumour is impossible to verify, none have entered those lands since
^^^^^^ the war ended and the orcs and thier minions were pushed back from most of the world.

**** Dragons do not exist in this world, yet, at least not how we picture them ****
^^ Bahamut, the great and Tiamat The Terrible will be born, as twins and lovers, from the festering corpse 
^^ of the old dead god, giving birth to the "first" of the new gods and the entire draconic hierarchy of creatures.
^^^^ This will be told as a narrative event as a one shot, story focused adventure.
^^ The power untapped by the dragons will be turned to smoke and ash, swirling in the ether between 
^^ worlds waiting to be consumed.


Sign's are acquired as brands from the church at a persons first census,
^^ or during birthing rituals, or other religious rites depending on the region
^^ A character cannot change signs, although the powers may be forfeit
^^^^ breaking the bonds of the sign will forfeit the associated benefits until
^^^^ a satifactory task is complete to regain favour
^^ A signless character cannot be branded with a sign, its not that they missed
^^^^^ the ritual but instead that they were not born under the stars that allow the brand to
^^^^^ commune with its associated god
^^^^^ Signless has not bonds to break so the benefits are not in jeopardy


Communion with the Old Gods
^^ Taken as part of a ritual, often requiring a special location, item and a sacrifice
^^ the player will be given the opportunity to commune with the old gods @ lvl 5, 10 and 15.
^^ alternatives to communion also exist, not planned yet...


**** Levels of "divinity" ****
There are events and actions in this setting that convey divine status and blessing
^^ a level of divinity grants 2 ability points or a feat or 1 spell slot of highest possible level.
^^ there are flavours of divinity that differ from the above spec
