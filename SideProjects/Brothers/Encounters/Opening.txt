game opens on a characters, solitary one, probably the druid if we have one
^^ or barbarian if we have one

hes minding his business when another character/ group stumble upon him
^^ the rangers...

The rangers say they are tracking a group of goblins.... ask if they saw them?
^^ boom, the goblins come ambushing these players  out of the woods nearby
?26? of them, surrounded and surprised the head rangers calls a tactical retreat to more defensible territory

Cut to the Caravan, the guardsmen are chatting about how these woods used to be bustling 
with activity and worry that something must be amiss.

If theres another loner character he is over taken by the caravan and falls in, meeting the chars 
on the caravan in the process.

The caravan slows as they approach a river crossing and a few of the guardsmen move ahead to 
check the stability of the bridge.....

Cut to the rangers running through the woods with the Druid/ whoever in the group,
Dex saves to not trip at least once each then they run out into a clearing to find the caravan 
stopped on the road a dozen meters away. The caravan hails them but they run across the 
road and take up a position behind the caravan, shouting incoherent warnings of the goblins....

Out crash the pack of goblins.... roll initiative...
