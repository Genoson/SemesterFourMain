Very early quest:

A bridge thats broken. 
Party should be able to cross the river, but the cart won't so they need a solution
Enter the troll, he just chilling, napping even, not far from the bridge, upstram along the shore.
Past him, you see a shallows and sand bar. but the cart wont fit past him.

Fight the troll? (bad decision)
^^ AC 15
^^ HP 84
^^ troll regeneration
^^ multiattack, one bite 2 claws
^^^^ bite +7 hit 1d6+4
^^^^ claw +7 hit 2d6+4

Wake the troll and negotiate?
^^ he is surprisingly eloquent
^^ complains about some goblins
^^^^ They keep saying "uhh, Goblins are better than trolls"
^^^^ and "Filthy trolls are uglier than they are stupid"
^^^^ Bring me their balls and I'll let you pass

Goblins live in a burnt out and collapsing tower, 
maybe an old mages tower, 
maybe an old rangers watch tower

3 outside
^^ stealth take down possible

6 more inside, ones a boss
^^ Loudly singing and cooking 

5 on patrol
^^ only return if its important to the story... 
ie: the tutorial guide needs to die, or the party blow something up


Return with goblin balls and troll eats them like candy.
Thanks you and trundles on his way
