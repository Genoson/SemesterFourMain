A quest to encounter by talking to locals

Goats are being mutilated in a halfling hamlet outside of town
^^ the local economy is suffering, goat cheese is a major export here
^^ Townsfol give directions and a bounty of a prize wheel of cheese + gold 

At the halfling village all seems normal and happy
^^ bringing up the mutilations causes hushed tones and a general clearing out of the already
^^^^ slammed doors, shuttered windows
^^ investigation leads to the church, or rather the burned out husk of a church
^^^^ a lone old priest spends his days cleaning the ruins and praying
^^^^^^ he tells a story of how the local townsfolk blamed the church for the massacre of the goats
^^^^^^ He directs the players north towards a chasm in a cliff-face of a plateau at the edge of a nearby forest

on the way to the chasm the players may encounter locals, or enemies, of the natural to area variety

At the chasm players enter to find a series of passages and rooms carved into the rock
^^ ancient even by the standards of dwarves and elves
^^ iconography of eclipses, bleeding trees and humanoid sacrifice accompany an "unreadable" script

Imps, Spined devils and eventually the big boss cambion + his minions may be encountered along the way
^^ the players may also device a plan to collapse the cliff 
^^ or report their findings back to the church in an attempt to rally help.

Victory by removing an artifact from an alter beyond the cambion.
^^ several relics of a holy nature may be found here 
^^ they are clearly adorned with symbols of the gods
^^^^ One symbol may be encoutered that none recognize but is similar to the other god signs... mystery!?
