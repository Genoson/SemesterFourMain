A quest for early game

A Green Hag is manipulating several tribes of goblins to sow chaos and tragedy in the lands
around a nearby wood.

The Goblins raid one  another, the nearby farmsteads, and the nearby lumber mill.

An Orc Tribe resides by a bog to the north of these woods, also harrased by the goblins.

The Hag is elusive, but the Goblins and the Orc Tribe are not.

Killing the Hag will free the Goblins from her influence bringing a balance back to things.

Killing the goblin chieftans (3) will also end the goblins usefulness to the Hag.
^^ the orcs get recruited for a revenge mission by the hag in this instance

A particularly clever party might manage to get the orcs to help find and kill the hag.

If both goblins and orcs are dealt with and the hag still lives... who knows....
