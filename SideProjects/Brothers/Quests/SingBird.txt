A strange tune 

While walking near a copse of trees at twilight a song can be heard
^^ Players wander towards the song source if they fail a saving throw

In the copse of woods there are 3-12 Kobolds, dancing around inside a circle of stones
^^ The Kobolds are not hostile to players, but they will attack if they see them

The players that fail another save walk into teh circle and drop to their knees
^^ the kobolds then attak 

There exists 1-3 harpies in the trees aboe the circle of stones, they join the fight and attack the players
^^ once the kobolds have died or if a player detects them and engages tehm early

Rewarded with a strange flower in the center of the circle of stones and a large quantity of 
^^ harpy feathers, currency and an assortment of random, low value belongings
