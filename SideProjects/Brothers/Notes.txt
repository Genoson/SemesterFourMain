Things of note for character creation, setting and session 0 in general.

Setting - This is my pitch, we will finalize this at session 0
Old World - castles and cities few and far between, lots of small townships and wildlands.
^^ ~ 5000 years before modern sword coast stories
^^ Technology is limited, like super limited
^^ horses and animal husbandry in general are not common outside of a few civilized nations
^^^^ pack mules and carts are used for land trade
^^^^ trade and travel by sea has been limited due to a centuries long curse by the gods of the sea.
^^^^^^ a major river bound trade route is the main source of trade and travel.
^^^^^^ Lake Town is the capitol of trade for the world, the hub of commerce and knowledge.

Old Gods - very present and powerful
^^ characters are born under the sign of a chosen god 
^^^^ receive a boon when following
^^^^ receive a curse when dissapointing the god
^^ the southern reaches of the world are embroiled in a crusade for a sun god 
^^^^ they believe that the sun is the one true god
^^ much of the northern reaches are tribal and nomadic
^^^^ The Orcish Deity was slain, labelled as the great corrupter, at the end of the last crusade
^^^^^^ it's corpse rots deep in the anauroch dessert to this day, say the legends 

Magick - is uncommon
^^ outside of places where it is common, it is rare and shunned
^^^^ magick users often travel in secrecy and don't reveal their powers lightly
^^ clerical magick is common, channeling the gods is something all are acustomed to
^^^^ shamanistic and druidic magick falls under this category
^^^^^^ much rarer in the south

Races - all from the players manual are represented in the setting
^^ player characters are not able to be Tiefling, Dragonborn, or Drow
^^^^ furthermore half-orc is a major hindrance in much of civilized and uncivilized world 
^^ mountain dwarves don't often leave their mountain homes
^^ elves don't often leave thier woodlands homes
^^^^ except for a coming of age ritual that involves travel to each of the ancient woodland elfhomes
^^ elves don't like half-elves
^^ halflings can't have an origin that conflicts with halfling ideals(think Tolkien)
^^ gnomes are very uncommon
^^^^ many died in the last crusade against magick users
^^^^ the gnomish capitol, mage school, and great library were all burned

Classes - All are fair game in the players manual
^^ keep in mind the setting prejudices towards magick use 
^^ certain class choices will have major impacts on character background

Background - Some things to consider
^^ what was your up bringing?
^^ what did/do your parents do?
^^ how old are you?
^^ do/did you have a job?
^^ why are you here/travelling?
^^ do your characters already know each other?
^^ are you educated?
^^ have you travelled?

Game Things 
^^ level 1 to start
^^ we will level by milestones, not experience points
^^ will we have strict random rolls for character things?
^^^^ hp on lvl up, stats at creation, etc.
^^^^ Or will we use static predefined values?
^^ difficulty?
^^^^ I have ideas on how to balance this, but not sure how you guys want it to feel.
^^^^ at level 1 one good hit can kill pretty much everyone.
