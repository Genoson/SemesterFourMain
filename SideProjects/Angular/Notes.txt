Angular in my notes as a part of the Vision 33 stack
^^ however inspecting the homepage source, react was referenced....

core concepts similar to react:
Components
Routing
State management

Angular relies more heavily on its CLI then React.
^^ familiarize myself with the CLI early and use frequently


Don't be afraid of the documentation, its the best source of information

Angular schematics are files that define the structure of your project.
^^ modules, components and services can all be defined as schematics


Best practice to focus on view management in the Angular framework.
^^ let business logic and data be separated from the view into services.
