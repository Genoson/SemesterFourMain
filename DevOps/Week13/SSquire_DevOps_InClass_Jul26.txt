Dev Ops real industry fallout from security shortcomings

I chose a hack against LinkedIn from 2012
The 2012 LinkedIn hack refers to the computer hacking of LinkedIn on June 5, 2012. 
Passwords for nearly 6.5 million user accounts were thought to be stolen at the time. 
^^ 165 million was the actual number determined years later
^^^^ these were discovered for sale for 5 bitcoin total ( $2000 at the time, $100,000 today, $4 million at peak btc)
Yevgeniy Nikulin was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 88 months in prison. 
^^ Initial breach was determined to be from identity theft of an employee of LinkedIn.
^^^^ It's usually the human element that fails first / causes the initial entry point
^^ unsalted SHA-1 hashes
^^ SHA-1 - a well known hash function/algorythm from the 90's
^^^^ because SHA-1 was well known examples of unscrambled data is widely 
^^^^ available and can be used to crack the encryption
^^ unsalted - trivial to decrypt the whole batch with automated tools
^^^^ salt - an addition to a hash algorythm that is unique to each hash 
^^^^ salt might not make the password harder to crack, but it makes it so breaking one 
^^^^ hashed password doesn't unlock the batch
