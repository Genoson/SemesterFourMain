Docker - a tutorial on launching a app using Docker

Docker is a platform for running and shipping applications in a containerized environment.
^^ containerized environments ensure that your app is running in a secure environment, and that it is isolated from the rest of the system.
^^ they also ensure that the dependencies, versions and configuration of your app is consistent across all of your instances.


container vs virtual machine
a virtual machine is a simulation of an independant system on a larger system.
^^ each vm needs a full blown os, therefore slow to start and resource intensive

containers have all the advantages of virtual machines, but are much smaller and more lightweight.
^^ don't require their own OS and need fewer resources to start.


Docker uses a client server model.
^^ hte client communicates with the server via a restful api

docker applications have to be compatible with the kernel of the OS in order to run
^^mac os compatability requires a light linux vm

docker apps require a docker file
^^ a docker file is a text file that describes the app
^^ it tell the container how to run the app


to run a node app we need to:
start with an os
install node
copy the app file
run the app on node


docker images can be found at docker hub
^^ hub.docker.com



** Linux primer **
Alpine is  very small and light.
Ubuntu is a popular linux distribution.

docker run -it ubuntu
^^ this will run ubuntu in a terminal

apt is a package manager for linux
^^ we use apt install to install packages
^^ but first we should run apt update to get the latest packages

Kubernetes  - what is it, how does it work, how do we use it?

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system.
^^ unlike docker, kubernetes is not a single image.
^^ if docker is viewed as a shipping container then
^^ kubernetes is a shipping company


kubernetes has many components:
cluster - a collection of nodes
node - a computer that runs the cluster
master - the node that is the leader of the cluster
kube plane - a virtual network
kube dns - a dns server
kube proxy - a proxy server
kube controller - a controller server
kube scheduler - a scheduler server
kube apiserver - an api server
kube client - a client to interact with the api server
kubelet - a node to run the kubelet
pod - a container
service - a service to expose to the world


Canary deployments are easily managed by kubernetes.

Amigoscode has a kubernetes tutorial
^^ uses minikube
^^^^ minikube is a virtual machine that runs kubernetes on a local machine
^^ uses kubectl
^^^^ a command line tool to interact with the kubernetes

kubernetes uses yml files to describe the cluster.
^^ yml files are easy to read and write.
