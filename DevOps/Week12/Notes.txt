SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle

Secure SDLC 

How to bake security into your product
^^ a multifaceted approach

A partnership between all team members in the product

1 - Security Training
^^ security 101, common issues, indicators
^^ new hires, annual refreshers, 
^^ Scalability, knowledge sharing, Mindset, culture,
^^ ex: Phishing

2 - Architecture review - architecture flaws are the hardest to change
^^ profile the tech, analyze the attack surface, ensure not vulnerable by design
^^ Product planning, 
^^ vulnerabilities often arise during design phase, secure by default

3 - Security requirements
^^ best practices, product specific
^^ confirmed architecture, tech stack, etc
^^ checklist, tickets, sprints, complete while building
Tools - SD elements, GoSDL

4 - Threat modeling
^^ map the assets, protections in place, threats, understand threat vectors
^^ closer to end of development/ design
^^ lock down easy attack paths, 

5 - Static code analysis
^^ scan code for obvious issues
^^ as soon as code is checked in, automate
^^ catch issues as soon as possible, remediate it as soon as possible

6 - open source analysis - super important and easy to do ***
^^ open source dependency versions, known safe versions
^^ When code is checked in, automate
^^ avoid introducing critical vulnerabilities
Tools - WhiteSource, SourceClear, Snyk

7 - Dynamic Testing
^^ automate Testing, black box
^^ stable product, staging environment, QA
^^ Find issues that script kiddies can exploit

8 - Penetration Testing
^^ hacking your product
^^ before product release, staging environment
^^ hackers will do this anyway, you might as well find the issues first
