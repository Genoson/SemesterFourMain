Reviewing and finishing IAC discussion
Infrastructure as code

Benefits of IAC -
Speed - after initial set up  it is quick launch future projects
Consistency - configuration is consistent across all the projects
Accountability - 
increased efficiency - 
lower cost - 

IAC can be divided into two main types

imperative and declarative

imperative is a series of steps to follow to get to the desired outcome


declarative lays out the desired outcome and the code automates the process of reaching it


IAC tools
Cloud Formation - AWS
Azure Resource Manager - Azure
Google Cloud Deployment Manager - GCP(Google)
Terraform 
Chef
Ansible
Puppet



IAC is used in devops to automate the process of deploying a new application to a new environment
freeing up time for the team to focus on maintenance and development of new features, etc.


Monolithic services - one large application that is deployed to a single environment
- testing is a massive endeavour and small changes can be very hard to test
- small bugs cause ripples through the system, sometimes causing major issues that are 
hard to trace
- builds take a long time
- deployment is a costly process and long
- maintenance is a costly process and long
- scaling is a major challenge


Microservices - a collection of loosely coupled services that are deployed to a single environment
- testing is easier and faster



Macroservice - modular application that interacts with microservices to achieve a desired outcome


It is hard o migrate from a monolithic application to microservices.
using macroservices as a bridge and factoring more and more services out
until a fully microservice architecture is reached
