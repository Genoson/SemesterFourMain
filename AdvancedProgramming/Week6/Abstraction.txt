Abstraction is a method of hiding the details of a codebase in java
^^ you cannot instantiate an abstract class, it is restricted
^^ abstract methods can only be used in the abstract class. 

We use inheritance to create a class that inherits from an abstract class


Interface, another method of abstraction in java
^^ a completely abstract class that is used to group related methods
^^ interfaces can only be used as a type, not as an object
^^ we implement interfaces by using the implements keyword
ie: public class MyClass implements MyInterface{}

When you implement an interface, you must implement all the methods in the interface
^^ override the methods in the interface

interface methods are abstract and public by default

Interface attribute are public, static and final by default

There are no constructors in interfaces.

A class can implement multiple interfaces
ie: public class MyClass implements MyInterface1, MyInterface2{}


Enums are a special type of class that can be used to create a set of constants
ie: public enum MyEnum{}
^^ by convention the name of the enum is capitalized
^^ enums are used to create a set of constants
 an enum can be declared inside a class or outside of a class

 often used in conjunction with switch statements

 we can loop through an enum using a for loop
ie:     for(MyEnum myEnum : MyEnum.values()){}

Scanner is a class that allows us to read input from the user
^^ we use the nextLine() method to read a line of input (String)
^^ we use the nextInt() method to read an integer (int)
^^ we use the nextDouble() method to read a double (double)
^^ we use the nextBoolean() method to read a boolean (boolean)
^^ etc
