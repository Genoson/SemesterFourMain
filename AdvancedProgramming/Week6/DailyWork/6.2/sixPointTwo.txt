The class diagram of this example code 

                    Animal
                        ^^
        Cat                     Dog
                                     ^^
                                Big Dog



the output would be as follows:
Meow!
Woof!
Woow!

neither of the three examples under polymorphism would be able to be compiled.

the first example in downcasting I don't think will compiled
Woooooooooof!
doesn't compile
doesnt compile
Woooooooooow!

^^ guessing based on reading the code, did not test
