We are doing exception handling 
^^ when to throw an exception
^^ when to catch an exception
^^ how to handle an exception of a specific type


A very important part of developing production code is exception handling.
^^ without good exception handling, your code will crash and burn.
^^^^ paying customers do not like this.

errors and exceptions
the difference between errors and exceptions 

We should write code in an exception execution block
try block
catch block (can be more than one)
finally block (optional)

we can use e.getmessage() to get the error message

Steve, good exception handling, start to consider it everywhere
^^ when should you avoid using exceptions?(should you ever)
^^^^ 


throw is used to manually throw an exception

throws is used to declare that a method throws an exception
