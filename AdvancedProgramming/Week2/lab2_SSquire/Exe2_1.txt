1. 5 objects/ classes of a hospital system.
^^ a. Admission Form
^^ b. Discharge Form
^^ c. Prescription
^^ d. X-Ray

^^ many objects in such a system would be inter related. an Xray could link to both
the doctor who requested it and the patient of whom it was taken.

2. a. doctor
^^ A doctor would have attributes like specialty, name, contact info, and a list of patients
as well as many more possible attributes.
^^ behaviours(methods) of a doctor would be like ordering an xray, prescribing a drug, and
discharging a patient. As well as systemic methods like clocking in and out and countless
others depending on the need of the system. 
ie: doctor.getLabReport(patient)

b. patient
^^ A patient would have attributes like name, age, contact info, list of doctors, and many more
possible attributes.
