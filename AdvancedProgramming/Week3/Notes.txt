Week 3 notes for Advanced programming with java

this weeks topics: 

static variables and static methods we have covered

we have been adding methods to classes this whole time, this is something we will continue to do

Method overloading is a feature of java that allows us to have multiple methods with the same name
^^ must have different parameters somehow

class stack and activation record

access and non-access modifiers and the final keyword

scope of declaration

Aggregation \ cross class relationships


Tuesday may 17 notes:

Static variables are shared by all instances of a class and accessed using the class name
ie: Class.variableName

static methods are shared by all instances of a class and accessed using the class name
ie: Class.methodName(type params) outside of the class
and inside the class you can access the static method by:
ie: methodName(type params)
the public static void main method is a static method
static methods cannot access non-static variables

a static block is a block of code that is executed when a class is loaded into memory
declared:
static {
    //code
}

if a class has multiple static blocks, they are executed in the order they are declared



access modifiers:
public - accessible to any class 
default - accessible to any class in the same package

private - accessible only within the class
protected - accessible to any class in the same package and subclasses

non-access modifiers:
final - cannot be overridden / cannot be extended
abstract - cannot be instantiated

rarely used non access modifiers:
transient - not serialized / not stored in the object file

synchronized - thread safe / synchronized methods

volatile - thread safe / volatile variables


*** Personal task - write a doubly linked list in java ***


method call stack is the order in which methods are called and then executed 
by the program on execution

activation record is the stack frame that is used to store the local variables

scope of declaration and aggregation will be covered in tomorrow's class

Give methods meaningful, concise names. 
^^ if this is hard your methods might be doing too many tasks
try to keep methods to a single task
try to keep methods to returning a single value or object

variables should be declared as fields (instance variables)

parameters cannot be typed as a group

aggregations in Ainees' diagrams are represented by a diamond

come on steve, this. is a reference to the current object and should be used 
more in my code
