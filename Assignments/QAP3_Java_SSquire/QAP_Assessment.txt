QAP 3
Stephen Squire
June 15th, 2022

1. I spent ~ 2 hours on this assignment.

2. I used no additional resources other than the knowledge I had Acquired up to this point.

3. I did not seek help from my peers.

4. I did not seek help from the faculty.

5. This was a great assignment to practice inheritance, abstraction and interfaces.
I would rate this a 3/10 on the difficulty scale. There was some mental gymnastics involved
in getting the formulas formatted correctly in the second problem.
