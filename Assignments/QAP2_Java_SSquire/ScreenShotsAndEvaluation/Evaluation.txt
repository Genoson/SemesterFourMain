QAP 2 Advanced Programming with Java
Stephen Squire
May 31, 2022

1. This QAP took me ~ 2 hours to complete.

2. I used no resources while attempting this QAP. I have been doing w3schools Java tutorial and
all the assigned work for this course.

3. No, I did not reach out for any help from my peers.

4. No, I did not reach out to any Instructors for help.

5. This was a fairly easy QAP as well, probably 3 out of 10. The String Practice Problem set from 
last week was a good bit more difficult than this. 
I never know how many comments to leave in the code, most fo the time the comments like:
// these are the getters and setters 
feel redundant and like unnecessary clutter to me. But I did comment some of the files that way 
and left in some troubleshooting comments as well.
