Stephen Squire QAP 1 Assessment Java

1. This QAP took me about 90 minutes to complete.

2. I used no resources to solve this QAP, it was all on material we had thoroughly covered. 
Prior to receiving the assignment I studied the prescribed readings and problems as well as 
working through the w3schools java tutorials. I also occasional use stack overflow and 
youtube tutorials to help me solve problems in my studies.

3. No, I did not have to reach out to any of my peers for help.

4. I asked Dr. Ainee for clarification on "proper comments" and some minor issues in wording of the QAP.

5. This QAP was probably a 1 / 10 difficulty for me. I could definitely solve more and more difficult variations
of this QAP.
