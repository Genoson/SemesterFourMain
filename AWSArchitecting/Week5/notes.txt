Going over module 5 reading materials as a class with Kennedy.
Will attempt to complete module 6 this week and stay a week ahead of the curve.

oAuth authentication is something that kennedy reccomends us to familiarize ourselves with.
^^ this is a very commonly used module

Scalability is the ability to resize a service to meet demand, dynamically.
^^throughput is the number of requests that can be handled in a given amount of time.

Total storage requirement - the total amount of storage space that a service needs to store data.
^^ this is a very important concept in the cloud. 
^^ underestimates can break services. 
^^ over estimates cost a lot
^^ locking in to an unscaleable data store can cause problem down the road

object size and type - the size and type of data that a service needs to store.
^^ must match the storage requirements of the service.

Durability - the ability to store data in a way that is persistent and durable.
^^ fault tolerant


ACID 
A = Atomicity - the ability to store data in a way that is atomic.
C = Consistency - the ability to store data in a way that is consistent.
I = Isolation - the ability to store data in a way that is isolated.
D = Durability - the ability to store data in a way that is durable.



vertical scaling - the ability to scale a service vertically.
^^ is when you add more power to increase performance


horizontal scaling - the ability to scale a service horizontally.
^^ is when you add more instances to increase performance (parallel)


Final sprint will involve writing api to query an amazon rds


OLAP
online analytical processing
