** Kennedy is asking us to map out a AWS architecture.
^^ for this upcoming sprint
^^^^ lucid charts are a good way to visualize this.

Kennedy recomends being able to use lucid charts to design architectures
^^ not just aws but also API

After building the design in lucid charts or figma
^^ we will use the design to build the architecture on aws
